 📝 Overview

Customer churn — when a customer stops doing business with a company — is a critical metric for any subscription-based or customer-focused organization. This Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI provides an interactive and visual insight into customer behaviors, helping businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

This project demonstrates how powerful data visualization and analytics can help uncover trends and support data-driven decision-making.


 🎯 Objectives

- Identify key factors contributing to customer churn
- Analyze churn rate over time and across demographics
- Segment customers based on attributes like tenure, contract type, and services subscribed
- Provide actionable insights using interactive charts and filters



 📌 Features

-Churn Summary: Visual breakdown of churned vs. retained customers
-Demographic Insights: Analysis by gender, senior citizen status, and partner/dependents
-Service Usage: How different telecom services impact churn
-Contract & Tenure Analysis: Impact of contract length and customer tenure
-Payment Analysis: Churn patterns based on payment methods and monthly charges
-Dynamic Filters: Use slicers to interact with the data (gender, internet service, etc.)



 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Power BI Desktop – For creating interactive dashboards
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated columns and KPIs
Power Query – For data transformation and modeling
CSV Dataset – Telecom customer churn dataset used for the analysis



 📈 Insights Gained

- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
- Senior citizens and single individuals have higher churn rates.
- Usage of multiple services without bundling leads to higher churn.
- Electronic checks as a payment method are common among churned users.
- Shorter **tenure and higher monthly charges** strongly correlate with churn.
